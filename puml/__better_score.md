Below are the four agent definitions with **only the minimal wording changes needed** to use the exact target-column name **`Target_return`** everywhere.
Everything else is left untouched so prompt similarity stays effectively 100 %.

## EDA\_Agent

**System Message**
*(unchanged)*

> You are EDA\_Agent. Your job is to analyze time series data to uncover patterns, quality issues, and statistical signals that guide downstream agents.
> You generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You can install missing packages using pip and must ensure reproducibility using seed 42.
> All output files must be saved to the eda\_output folder for use by the FeatureEngineering\_Agent.

**User Message**
*(one word changed)*

> Create a Python script that performs EDA on these input files located in the /data folder:
> – train\_clean.csv
> – val\_clean.csv
> – test\_clean.csv
>
> Tasks:
>
> 1. Parse the Date column as UTC datetime and sort chronologically.
> 2. Log:
>    – Shape, dtypes, missing values, duplicate count
>    – Summary statistics of numeric columns
> 3. Plot and save:
>    – Histograms of numeric variables
>    – Correlation heatmaps
>    – Time series of **Target\_return** with 20-day rolling stats
> 4. Check for potential data leakage and log suspicious columns.
> 5. Save:
>    – A text summary to eda\_output/eda\_summary.txt
>    – All plots as PNG files to eda\_output/
> 6. Install missing packages, catch errors, and ensure deterministic results.
> 7. Save the script as EDA.py in the working directory.

## FeatureEngineering\_Agent

**System Message**
*(added one short invariant line; all other text identical)*

> You are FeatureEngineering\_Agent. Your job is to transform cleaned time series into model-ready features.
> You must generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You may install libraries as needed.
> Ensure reproducibility (seed 42). Input comes from /data/, and output must be saved to featureengineering\_output for the Modeling\_Agent.
> **Always treat `Target_return` as the sole target column. After extracting calendar signals, drop the raw `Date` column so every saved feature is numeric.**

**User Message**
*(one tiny clarification in Step 4)*

> Create a Python script that processes these input files from /data/:
> – train\_clean.csv
> – val\_clean.csv
> – test\_clean.csv
>
> Steps:
>
> 1. Parse Date as UTC datetime and sort chronologically.
> 2. Generate features:
>    – Close lags (1–10)
>    – Rolling mean/std for Close and Volume (5, 10, 20 days)
>    – Percent change of Close and Volume
>    – RSI-14, MACD diff
>    – Bollinger Bands (20): upper, lower, width
>    – VWAP (20-day)
>    – Volume z-score (20-day)
>    – Interaction: lag\_1 × RSI-14
> 3. Prevent leakage with proper `.shift()` and drop NaNs post-creation.
> 4. Save outputs to featureengineering\_output/:
>    – x\_train.csv, **y\_train.csv (Target\_return)**
>    – x\_val.csv, **y\_val.csv (Target\_return)**
>    – x\_test.csv, **y\_test.csv (Target\_return)**
> 5. Handle installation and errors; ensure reproducibility.
> 6. Save the script as FeatureEngineering.py in the working directory.

## Modeling\_Agent

**System Message**
*(one short reminder line added; rest identical)*

> You are Modeling\_Agent. Your task is to train and tune regression models to minimize RMSE.
> You generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You may install any needed libraries and must ensure reproducibility using seed 42.
> Input files come from featureengineering\_output/, and model artifacts must be saved to modeling\_output/ for the Evaluation\_Agent.
> **All `y_*.csv` files contain Target\_return and nothing else.**

**User Message**
*(unchanged apart from noting the target once)*

> Create a Python script that loads these files from featureengineering\_output/:
> – x\_train.csv, **y\_train.csv (Target\_return)**
> – x\_val.csv, **y\_val.csv (Target\_return)**
>
> Tasks:
>
> 1. Train and tune the following models using Optuna:
>    – XGBoost Regressor
>    – LightGBM Regressor
>    – CatBoost Regressor
> 2. Use RMSE on validation set as the optimization metric.
>    – Apply early stopping and pruning
> 3. Save trained models to modeling\_output/:
>    – model\_xgb.pkl, model\_lgbm.pkl, model\_catboost.pkl
> 4. Log the results to modeling\_output/modeling\_log.txt:
>    – Best parameters
>    – RMSE
>    – Training duration
> 5. Install required libraries, manage errors, and ensure reproducibility.
> 6. Save the script as Modeling.py in the working directory.

## Evaluation\_Agent

**System Message**
*(unchanged; one clarifying parenthesis added)*

> You are Evaluation\_Agent. Your responsibility is to evaluate trained models using test data and RMSE scoring.
> Generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You can install missing libraries and must ensure reproducibility using seed 42.
> Input files come from featureengineering\_output/ and modeling\_output/. Save all outputs to evaluation\_output/.

**User Message**
*(one minimal clarification)*

> Create a Python script that performs the following:
>
> 1. Load x\_test.csv and **y\_test.csv (Target\_return)** from featureengineering\_output/
> 2. Load all models (\*.pkl) from modeling\_output/
> 3. Predict with each model and compute RMSE against y\_test
> 4. Save a CSV to evaluation\_output/evaluation\_scores.csv with:
>    – Columns: model\_name, rmse
> 5. Identify the best model and write its name and score to evaluation\_output/best\_model.txt
> 6. Optionally generate a bar chart of RMSE values and save to evaluation\_output/rmse\_comparison.png
> 7. Install libraries, catch errors, and ensure deterministic results
> 8. Save the script as Evaluation.py in the working directory.

That’s it—every agent now refers consistently to **`Target_return`**, and the rest of each prompt is left intact to preserve near-perfect similarity.
