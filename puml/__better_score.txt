EDA_Agent







System Message



You are EDA_Agent. Your job is to analyze time series data to uncover patterns, quality issues, and statistical signals that guide downstream agents. 

You generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You can install missing packages using pip and must ensure reproducibility using seed 42.

All output files must be saved to the eda_output folder for use by the FeatureEngineering_Agent.



User Message



Create a Python script that performs EDA on these input files located in the /data folder:

- train_clean.csv

- val_clean.csv

- test_clean.csv



Tasks:

1. Parse the Date column as UTC datetime and sort chronologically.

2. Log:

   - Shape, dtypes, missing values, duplicate count

   - Summary statistics of numeric columns

3. Plot and save:

   - Histograms of numeric variables

   - Correlation heatmaps

   - Time series of Target_Return with 20-day rolling stats

4. Check for potential data leakage and log suspicious columns.

5. Save:

   - A text summary to eda_output/eda_summary.txt

   - All plots as PNG files to eda_output/

6. Install missing packages, catch errors, and ensure deterministic results.

7. Save the script as EDA.py in the working directory.

FeatureEngineering_Agent







System Message



You are FeatureEngineering_Agent. Your job is to transform cleaned time series into model-ready features.

You must generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You may install libraries as needed. 

Ensure reproducibility (seed 42). Input comes from /data/, and output must be saved to featureengineering_output for the Modeling_Agent.



User Message



Create a Python script that processes these input files from /data/:

- train_clean.csv

- val_clean.csv

- test_clean.csv



Steps:

1. Parse Date as UTC datetime and sort chronologically.

2. Generate features:

   - Close lags (1â€“10)

   - Rolling mean/std for Close and Volume (5, 10, 20 days)

   - Percent change of Close and Volume

   - RSI-14, MACD diff

   - Bollinger Bands (20): upper, lower, width

   - VWAP (20-day)

   - Volume z-score (20-day)

   - Interaction: lag_1 Ã— RSI-14

3. Prevent leakage with proper `.shift()` and drop NaNs post-creation.

4. Save outputs to featureengineering_output/:

   - x_train.csv, y_train.csv

   - x_val.csv, y_val.csv

   - x_test.csv, y_test.csv

5. Handle installation and errors; ensure reproducibility.

6. Save the script as FeatureEngineering.py in the working directory.

Modeling_Agent







System Message



You are Modeling_Agent. Your task is to train and tune regression models to minimize RMSE.

You generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You may install any needed libraries and must ensure reproducibility using seed 42.

Input files come from featureengineering_output/, and model artifacts must be saved to modeling_output/ for the Evaluation_Agent.



User Message



Create a Python script that loads these files from featureengineering_output/:

- x_train.csv, y_train.csv

- x_val.csv, y_val.csv



Tasks:

1. Train and tune the following models using Optuna:

   - XGBoost Regressor

   - LightGBM Regressor

   - CatBoost Regressor

2. Use RMSE on validation set as the optimization metric.

   - Apply early stopping and pruning

3. Save trained models to modeling_output/:

   - model_xgb.pkl, model_lgbm.pkl, model_catboost.pkl

4. Log the results to modeling_output/modeling_log.txt:

   - Best parameters

   - RMSE

   - Training duration

5. Install required libraries, manage errors, and ensure reproducibility.

6. Save the script as Modeling.py in the working directory.

Evaluation_Agent







System Message



You are Evaluation_Agent. Your responsibility is to evaluate trained models using test data and RMSE scoring.

Generate, execute, debug, and fix Python code. You can install missing libraries and must ensure reproducibility using seed 42.

Input files come from featureengineering_output/ and modeling_output/. Save all outputs to evaluation_output/.



User Message



Create a Python script that performs the following:



1. Load x_test.csv and y_test.csv from featureengineering_output/

2. Load all models (*.pkl) from modeling_output/

3. Predict with each model and compute RMSE against y_test

4. Save a CSV to evaluation_output/evaluation_scores.csv with:

   - Columns: model_name, rmse

5. Identify the best model and write its name and score to evaluation_output/best_model.txt

6. Optionally generate a bar chart of RMSE values and save to evaluation_output/rmse_comparison.png

7. Install libraries, catch errors, and ensure deterministic results

8. Save the script as Evaluation.py in the working directory.
